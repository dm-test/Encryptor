It is easy to notice that if all letters in a specified language were equally often, then the expected value would be equal to 1. Of course, in all the existing languages different letters occur with different frequencies so indexes of coincidence for different languages differ from each other. For English the expected value is equal to 1,73.One will notice that the index of coincidence calculated for two texts written in two different languages is usually noticeably smaller than expected indexes of coincidence calculated for these languages. It is caused by the fact that the letters which are popular in the first text (in the first language), may be less popular in the second text (written in the second language). Thus, the probability of meeting the same letters in the compared texts is smaller.
